Sometimes crashes when camera is moved far away from the polygons. Antialiasing implemented. 

Movement and controls:

Keypad: move relative to the camera

I/K: move up/down
J/L: strafe left/right
U/O: look down/up
WASD: move the light source in the xz-plane
Q/E: move the light source down/up
1/2/3/4/5: change the antialiasing level, 1 is no AA
T: toggle edge detection (for the project)
