1. How many valid Host IP addresses belong to the subnet 172.16.128.0/18?

	2^14-2 = 16384-2 = 16382

	255.255.192.0 in dotted decimal.

2. What is ARP and why is it needed?

	ARP is used to establish a lookup table between network addresses and MAC addresses.

	Packets are sent to a physical unit, and the network must know where to find the unit. If a computer is moved and its IP changes, the network must still be able to send data to the correct MAC-address.


3. Explain the role of the port numbers in the transport layer.

	The different ports are used by different applications on the computer. When a package comes in, the program which has reserved the port on which the data comes in will receive the data.


4. Write the ttcp commands for both sender and receiver, which executes the following
scenario: Send a TCP stream from host 10.2.3.4 to 10.4.5.6 on port 3333. The sender
should send 4000 bytes with four datagrams of 1000 bytes in each datagram.


	Sender:
	ttcp -t -l 1000 -n4 -p 3333 10.4.5.6

	Receiver:
	ttcp -r -l 1000 -n4 -p 3333

5. Suppose a TCP sender receives an ACK packet in which the acknowledgement number
is set to 12345 and the window size is 2048. Which sequence numbers can the sender
transmit?

	The sender can transmit 2048 bytes, starting with byte number 12345. This results in the sequence 12345-14392.


6. Briefly describe the following algorithms and when they are used:

• Nagle’s algorithm.

	As long as no acknowledgement has been received, pile up the data to be sent and send as one packet.

• Karn’s algorithm.

	Ignore the calculation of the RTT if the packet was retransmitted, calculate RTT only if the packet was transmitted once.

• Delayed acknowledgement.

	Delay sending an acknowledgement for a amount of time, or until two acknowledgements has ackumulated. This saves network usage, but can reduce performance.


• Piggybacked acknowledgement.

	Instead of sending an acknowledgement as its own packet, attach it to a data packet and send both at the same time.



7. How is the retransmission timeout (RTO) value computed in TCP?

		First a measurement R is made, and a heartbeat granularity G is chosen. SRTT is set to R, RTTVAR is set to R/2, and RTO is set to SRTT + max(G, k*RTTVAR).

		After a new measurement R', RTTVAR is set to (1-b)*RTTVAR+b*|SRTT-R'|
		SRTT is set to (1-a)*SRTT + a*R'

		a and b are values between 0 and 1. 


8. Explain the following TCP mechanisms:

• Sliding window flow control.

	The use of synchronized sending and receiving windows for the data, to control which packets to send to transmit the datagram as fast as possible.

• Slow start and congestion avoidance.

	Slow start starts by sending small packets, then doubles the allowed number of sent packets without acknowledgement until a treshold is reached. Congestion avoidance reduces the packet size if the acknowledgement for a packet is not received within RTO. 

• Fast retransmit and fast recovery.

	Is useful when a few packets are lost. The senders waits for three duplicate acknowledgements before resending the data which was lost, and keeps sending data while waiting for the duplicates.
