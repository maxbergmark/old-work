Stockholm, Sweden

22 years old

[b]4. How would you describe yourself in 3 words?[/b]

[b]1. Add here your Battle Tag please.[/b]

cremefraiche#2243

[b]2. List your guild history.[/b]

Seventh Legacy-Darksorrow (maybe shouldn't include this, we were complete shit)
Stress Management-Darksorrow (current guild)

[b]3. What is your raiding experience?[/b]

In TBC I raided a bit, killed Gruul, did som Karazhan, some Zul'Aman, nothing fancy.
In WotLK, I pugged Onyxia, ToC, VoA, Ulduar (a few bosses), nothing special there.
After a 4 year break, I started playing again in WoD.
Our guild got 4/10M before we had to take a break due to lack of people.
In the current tier we have 11/13M, and have gotten Mannoroth to 40%.

[b]4. Why are you leaving your current(last) guild?[/b]

Lack of skill and determination in the rest of the raid team. I'm looking for a guild who wants to progress Mythic in Legion and actually aim towards a high rank.

[b]5. Why would you like to to join Aggressive Authority?[/b]

After looking through WoWProgress, you seem like the best choice. Your raiding schedule fits me really well, and from what I see your mindset seems to be the same as mine. Even if I haven't got 10 years of raiding experience, I know how to play my class, I know how to perform during progression and I know how not to stand in fire. It would be nice to play with 19 other people who share that knowledge.

[b]6. Do you know anyone in the guild?[/b]

I know all the officers (wink wink)

[b]6. Logs (Provide your most recent logs)[/b]

https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/7578965/latest/#boss=0
The only logs I'm not really satisfied with at the moment are Gorefiend and Xhul'horac, because apparently, the rest of my raid team don't know how to kill adds. 

[b]7. Raid UI Screenshot (Must be taken during combat in a raid environment)[/b]

http://imgur.com/QEO5GVF (don't hate on the default Blizzard bars, I like them)
A lot of things in my UI are hard to capture, since my philosophy is that if there isn't a problem, nothing should be shown)

I've come to like LUA coding lately, and I have produced a few weakauras/macros utilizing this.

[size=20][color=#ffcc33]Class Knowledge[/color][/size]

[b]1. Explain the fundamental idea behind your rotation/priority system for both ST and AoE.[/b]

For AoE, it's basically just equip SoC and multidot, and then single target rotation on priority targets.
I always try to cheeze my Sunfires to spread them to as many targets as possible. 

For single target, I usually go with DSI and Sandman's Pouch (or DSI/loom trinket for demons). I could go on about how the eclipse meter works, and what threshold values are important (30-40 for lunar, 40-60 for solar) but that's really basic, and I should be expected to know that. 

For my opener I always go incarnation->pot->surge->CA->dots->starfire x2->(the rest of the fight) and no refresh of dots in CA. I only change that opener for certain bosses where Time Warp is delayed (Gorefiend, Iskar, Xhul). For those bosses I open with a simple pot->surge->moonfire->starfire->(the rest of the fight).

For single target, I stack a bit more crit than I do for AoE, but with the gear that I currently have, it's only the trinkets that I change. Since haste is better for AoE, I might use Spur of the Great Devourer for single target and Warhammer of Arrogance for AoE. 

[b]2. Explain your general talent and glyph choice, point-out using specific talents and glyphs for some fights in the current raid tier if relevant.[/b]

As boomkin:

Glyphs:

[list]
[*]Glyph of Stampeding Roar: Good raid utility, useful on practically every boss
[*]Glyph of Moonwarding: Useful on fights with magic damage (practically every fight)
[*]Glyph of the Shapemender: Minor improvement, better than having no glyph there

[*]Glyph of Untamed Stars: A must-have, I need to ninja pull all trash in every raid
[*]Glyph of Stars: Basically responsible for 60% of my dps
[*]Glyph of Grace: Really useful in a raid environment (no one believes me)
[/list]
   The glyph choices aren't really set in stone for a boomkin, since there's no DPS increase from any glyph.

   Talents:
[list]
[*]Displacer Beast: Has saved my ass on more than one occasion
[*]Typhoon/Ursol's Vortex: My special little mass grip (useful in a lot of situations)
[*]Incarnation: Because bursting is fun (the other choices have lower DPS)
[*]Euphoria: I've never tried anything else, and based on my simulations, I never will.
[/list]

As resto:

   Glyphs:
[list]
[*]Glyph of Stampeding Roar: Same as above
[*]Glyph of Regrowth: Good quick heal
[*]Glyph of Wild Growth: works well with SotF

[*]Glyph of the Sprouting Mushroom: Makes my life simpler
[/list]

   Talents:

[list]
[*]Soul of the Forest: Increased overall healing, sometimes I'll go Incarnation if needed
[*]Heart of the Wild: Really useful towards the end of fights, where extra healing output is vital.
[*]Germination: See Euphoria for answer
[/list]

[b]3. Pick one or more fights from the current raid tier that you believe your class is best at and explain why.[/b]

If I said any fight other than Council I'd be lying. There isn't any fight where boomkin is the very best class, but at least it's top 5 on Council, and I'm able to output quite high sustained DPS throughout the fight. Being able to multidot and having Starfall on all targets really boosts my DPS.

[b]4. Is there a fight in the current raid tier you would consider disadvantageous to your class?[/b]

I'd have to say Xhul and Mannoroth. Both fights have waves of imps that are just impossible to get any good damage on. If I have Starfall and Sunfire on the imps, there's nothing more that I can do except single target one of them or use Hurricane (god forbid). Thus, I'll just go pure single target on prio targets and multidot.

[b]5. List addons that you use for raiding.[/b]

TellMeWhen
WeakAuras
DBM
Exorsus Raid Tools
Vuhdo
Skada
RC Lootcouncil


[b]6. What sources do you use for theorycrafting and how do you keep yourself updated?[/b]

Sometimes I try to sift through the Balance thread on MMO champion, where I'm quite sure that 95% of people posting haven't actually entered HFC. 

When I'm not busy doing that, I prefer to do my own theorycrafting, with simulations, calculations and discussions with other boomkins/experienced raiders.

[b]1. Link the test results for your connection.[/b] http://www.speedtest.net/

http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5066998265 (might upgrade to 100/100, haven't decided)

[b]2. Do you ever experience disconnects or lag issues when you play WoW?[/b]

Lately my ISP has been shittier than usual. For 3 years I didn't have a single disconnect, and last month I have experienced some. However, it hasn't affected my raiding. If it's needed, I'll use my phone's network to raid, I get a stable 60-80ms there usually, have tested raiding on it before.

[b]3. You can add here any relevant information that you think might help with your application.[/b]
