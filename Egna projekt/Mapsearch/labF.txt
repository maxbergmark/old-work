Input: every packet enters this chain which enters the machine
Forward: every packet which survived the input chain and is headed to another computer enters this chain
Output: packets going out of the machine enters this chain

Append: appends a rule to the specified chain. Used when rule order doesn't matter
Insert: like append, but rule order can be specified
Delete: deletes a rule in a particular chain by number
List: lists all the rules in a specified chain, or in every chain
Flush: flushes the chain, removing every rule in the chain, or from every chain.

-p: matches a protocol, could be icmp, tcp, udp, or all
-s: sets the source for a particular packet
-d: sets the destination hostname, ip, or network of a packet that matches the rule. 
-i: sets the incoming network interface, such as eth0 or ppp0. Only used with the input and forward chains.
-o: sets the outgoing network interface for a rule, only used with output and forward chains.
--sport: sets the source port of the packet. same syntax as --dport.
--dport: sets the destination port for a packet. use a service name, a port number, or a range of port numbers.

Accept: allows the packet to successfully move to its destination
Drop: drops the packet without alerting the requester
Reject: sends an error packet back to the requester and drops the packet
Log: logs all packet that match this rule. Where these are logged can be specified.
